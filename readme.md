# Note: 
> I made two branches on this repo, the main one containing gradle because I got bored and added gradle so I can add packages and make a useless feature, files are stored in the src folder for both branches

> and the other branch "WithoutGradle" is as it says and it's a version of this code without gradle and just the bare bones of the assignment
